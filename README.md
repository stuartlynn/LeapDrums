# Leap Drump

My inital play with the Leap motion.  Idea is to create a virtual drum kit that responds to motion events with velocity sensitive controlls.

Drums are just square regions just now but will hopefully end up being full models with some virtual drum sticks to boot. 

Requires the leap motion and the leap applicaiton running
